# Simple-Spell-Corrector
Simple Spell Corrector Algorithm written in Java


- Spell corrector for validating the keywords and suggesting proper word. 

It not only checks against a dictionary, but, if it doesnâ€™t find the keyword in the dictionary, it suggests a
most likely replacement. Word suggestion associates with every word in the dictionary a frequency, the percent of the time that word is expected to appear in a large document.
