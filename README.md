# Simple-Spell-Corrector
Simple Spell Corrector Algorithm written in Java


- Spell corrector for validating the keywords we type into the input text box. 

It not only checks against a dictionary, but, if it doesn’t find the keyword in the dictionary, it suggests a
most likely replacement.
Word suggestion associates with every word in the dictionary a frequency, the percent of the time that word is expected to appear in a large document. When a word is misspelled (i.e. it is not found in the dictionary) Google suggests a “similar” word (“similar” will
be defined later) whose frequency is larger or equal to any other “similar” word.
